# RL-blog

This is a Full stack blogging website inspired by **[Medium](https://medium.com/)**.
Client side was built with React and the Server side was built with Node + GraphQL + MongoDB.

The application is not fully built yet, but it can post and edit a blog with markdown format and it also has user authentication
normal auth and using FacebookAuth. 
I want to create more functions for the blog creators, like deleting and other features that i can add in the future.

I used these technologies to practice and play with GraphQL and Redux.

## To install and run the project.
since i'm using MongoDB, the app needs to have a MONGO_URI to be able to run server side functions
- git clone https://github.com/ronrix/RL-blog.git

Do a split screen terminal to be able to run these simultaneously
- cd server && npm install
- cd client && npm install
- cd client && npm run dev
- cd server && npm run dev
